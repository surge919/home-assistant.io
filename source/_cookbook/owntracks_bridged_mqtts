### {% linkable_title Setting up OwnTracks with 2 MQTT (mosquitto) brokers bridged for use with the MQTT bridge for SmartThings %}

I successfully tied in OwnTracks to HASS and SmartThings while using authentication for external access.

The MQTT bridge doesn't support authentication so I set up 2 MQTT instances.

Here are the steps I performed.. Hopefully it saves someone else some time.

It seems to be working pretty well but if anyone sees something incorrect in my config, please let me know.
This is my first real interaction with MQTT so if anyone seems something incorrect in my config, please let me know.

Here's a summary of my setup

2 Docker instances of MQTT
  -- 1 for internal use (the MQTT bridge for SmartThings - no authentication)
  -- 1 for external use ( with authentication - for OwnTracks)

All Docker config files are on my NAS so the docker can be destroyed with affecting my actual config files.



**Docker setup for the mosquitto internal instance.. no auth.. for use with the mqtt bridge**

```
docker run -ti -p 1883:1883  \
-v /volume1/data/mosquitto-int/config:/mqtt/config:ro \
-v /volume1/data/mosquitto-int/log:/mqtt/log \
-v /volume1/data/mosquitto-int/data/:/mqtt/data/ \
--name mosquitto-int -d toke/mosquitto
```


**Docker setup for the mosquitto external instance.. with auth.. for use with the owntracks**

```
docker run -ti -p 1884:1883  \
-v /volume1/data/mosquitto-ext/config:/mqtt/config:ro \
-v /volume1/data/mosquitto-ext/log:/mqtt/log \
-v /volume1/data/mosquitto-ext/data/:/mqtt/data/ \
-v /volume1/data/mosquitto-ext/etc:/etc/mosquitto \
--name mosquitto-ext -d toke/mosquitto
```

Here are the config files:

**/volume1/data/mosquitto-int/config/mosquitto.conf**

```

**create a password for mosquitto-ext**

```
docker exec -it mosquitto-ext /bin/bash

cd /etc/mosquitto/

mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile <userID>
```
